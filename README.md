# lesson1
######Using github for the first time.
**In this lesson you will not be programming.  Instead we are just doing a mock program so that you can practice how to modify and submit an assignment on github**
*First you will notice that there is a readme.md and a pizza.py file in the repository.  Often times I will be giving you a python file that already has some code in it.  You know the python file because it ends in .py.  Every repository by default has a readme.md file.  The .md stands for mark down.  Or in other words, it is a document that has a few keyed characters to modify its appearance.  Usually readme will include directions and not any code what so ever.*
*Remember this is your own repository.  So if you make changes to the python file or the readme file those changes stay with your repository.  It will not change the template repository that I made which you cloned.  However since I have a classroom account, I can see all of the changes that you have made to your repo.*
---------------------------------------------
Since this is the readme file, let me give you some directions.
* I want you to use the command line so go to your raspberry pi and use the bash command line
* Use the "General Steps ... " document on schoology to clone this assignment locally onto the raspberry pi.
* Edit the pizza.py file with IDLE or Thonny
* Type in any pizza ingredients that you know go into a pizza
* Save the file
* Go through the git commands to track the changes that you made and add it back to the repo (again see the document)
* Edit this readme file from your chromebook.  I have some questions at the end for you.
---------------------------------------------
1) When you saved the python file, did it automatically get saved to your repo on github?
2) Why do you think it is beneficial for git to track the changes that you have made to the program over time?
3) When you make a comment to a commit ( git commit -m "Some important message") is that comment for you to read, me to read, or some one else who wants to use your code to read?  Explain.
4) Can you run Python Code on the github website?
5) Have you ever downloaded code or games from github?  If yes, please describe also long as it is classroom appropriate.

FYI I will be showing/reading some student answers in class to demonstrate to everyone what I can see on github.
